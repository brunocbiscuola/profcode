   <h1>Letra</h1>
   <br> I follow the Moskva down to Gorky Park<br>
    Listening to the wind of change<br>
    An August summer night<br>
    Soldiers passing by<br>
    Listening to the wind of change<br>
    <br>
    The world is closing in<br>
    And did you ever think<br>
    That we could be so close like brothers?<br>
    The future's in the air<br>
    I can feel it everywhere<br>
    Blowing with the wind of change<br>
    <br>
    Take me<br>
    To the magic of the moment<br>
    On a glory night<br>
    Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)<br>
    In the wind of change<br>
    <br> 
    Hum-mm<br>
    <br>
    Walking down the street<br>
    And distant memories<br>
    Are buried in the past forever<br>
    I follow the Moskva and down to Gorky Park<br>
    Listening to the wind of change<br>
    <br>
    Take me (take me)<br>
    To the magic of the moment<br>
    On a glory night (a glory night)<br>
    Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)<br>
    In the wind of change (wind of change)<br>
    <br>
    The wind of change blows straight<br>
    Into the face of time<br>
    Like a storm wind that will ring<br>
    The freedom bell for peace of mind<br>
    Let your balalaika sing what my guitar wants to say (say)<br>
    <br>
    Take me (take me)<br>
    To the magic of the moment<br>
    On a glory night (a glory night)<br>
    Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)<br>
    In the wind of change (wind of change)<br>

    <h1>Letra</h1>
    <br>Won't you come here?<br>
You know the way<br>
It's the one you made, oh oh<br>
Built it in the sky,<br>
All that's in your eye<br>
Now not the same<br>
Watch it tumble down<br>
Falling all around, around<br>
Can you stand watching it undo<br>
All that's made of you?<br>
<br>
You can stay where you are<br>
I will wake you<br>
I will wake you in the morning (in the morning)<br>
You can stay where you are<br>
So don't you worry<br>
Don't you worry, keep on sleeping<br>
<br>
Now you see what you thought was yours<br>
Could never be had<br>
Take a look around,<br>
Try to understand<br>
That it's a game<br>
That you'll never hold<br>
Onto very long, long<br>
Where we are isn't just a place<br>
Where everything remains<br>
<br>
You can stay where you are<br>
I will wake you<br>
I will wake you in the morning (in the morning)<br>
You can stay where you are<br>
So don't you worry<br>
Don't you worry, keep on sleeping<br>
<br>
You can stay where you are<br>
You can stay where you are<br>
You can stay where you are<br>
You can stay where you are<br>
You can stay where you are<br>
You can stay where you are<br>
<br>
Now not the same<br>
Watch it tumble down<br>
Falling all around, around<br>
Can you stand watching it undo<br>
All that's made of you?<br>
<br>
I will wake you<br>
I will wake you in the morning<br>
So don't you worry<br>
Don't you worry, keep on sleeping<br>

    <h1>Letra</h1>
    <br>The people will survive<br>
In their environment<br>
The dirt, scarcity, and emptiness<br>
Of our South<br>
<br>
The injustices of our greed<br>
The practices we merit<br>
The dirt, scarcity and emptiness<br>
Of our South<br>
<br>
There on the beach<br>
I could see it in her eyes<br>
I only had a Corona<br>
Five cents deposit<br>
